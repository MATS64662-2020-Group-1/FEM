# Finite Element Modelling (FEM)

Assigned to: Sakina Rehman + Guy Bowker

This task involves using available open-source FE and image-analysis packages. The ‘cleaned’ image will be imported and using the generated mesh, assigned different material IDs/boundary conditions to different regions of the image. This highlights the importance of segmentation/mesh generation when pre-processing the image. From this, the packages will be used to create FE physics simulations e.g. deformation or heat flow in a composite.
Firstly, test cases will be created, which is a simple case where the solution is known (e.g. 1D heat conduction with a source at a known location) and compared to textbook/existing answers. If the solution is very different to the known solution, then it is clear that something is erroneous in the simulation. Each repository should have a suite of test cases to ensure the code is running as expected and to add a level of trust in the code. Each test case should be quick, easy to run and the solution should be clear.

In terms of finding the FE packages, a simple Google search of ‘FE packages in Python’ can be done or skimage, http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/index.html, https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy can be used. Examples should also be created showcasing the project, using the available resources, and recreated for this project.
