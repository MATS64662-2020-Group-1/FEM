The purpose of this test case is to combine methods from previous test cases to analyse one full microstructural image - assessing thermal conductivity through a Ti-6-4 sample that has been heated on the right to just above the beta transus, (980 degreesC) and stress components as the sample is compressed from the right, with all other edges at room temperature (22 degreesC) and no loads. It is assumed for this case that the elastic modulus and poissons ratio of alpha behaves as that of the elastic modulus of Ti6-4 at room temperature, as it is mostly composed of alpha. It is also assumed that the elastic modulus of beta behaves as that of room temperature fast-cooled ti-6-4 with 20% vanadium (as in page 17 of Lutjering & Williams) but that the poissons ratio and thermal conductivity of which remains the same as that of the alpha phase.
