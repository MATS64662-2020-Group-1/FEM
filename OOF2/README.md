## OOF2

OOF is designed to help materials scientists calculate macroscopic properties from images of real or simulated microstructures. It reads an image, assigns material properties to features in the image, and conducts virtual experiments to determine the macroscopic properties of the microstructure.

You can install OOF2 onto your PC but there is also an online version you can use by creating a nanoHUB.org account. (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/cgi-bin/redirect.py?url=https://www.nanohub.org/tools/oof2/)

If you do not want to use the online version you can download it will the instructions available on the OOF website. Alternatively, you can watch this video to help with the installation:
