# OOF2

OOF is designed to help materials scientists calculate macroscopic properties from images of real or simulated microstructures. It reads an image, assigns material properties to features in the image, and conducts virtual experiments to determine the macroscopic properties of the microstructure.

## In this folder

This folder contains each test case and the 2 final simulation results. The first test case is solely for familiarising oneself with the software, so basic shapes are used. From this, grains are then modelled and the complexity of each test is increased with each test case i.e. adding colour bars, looking at displacement maps etc. Using these test cases, the final simulations can be conducted for the globular and lameller Ti64 microstructure, with enough detail and accuracy to provide comparable and meaningful results.

## Installation

You can install OOF2 onto your PC but there is also an online version you can use by creating a nanoHUB.org account. (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/cgi-bin/redirect.py?url=https://www.nanohub.org/tools/oof2/)

You can also watch this video to help with the installation directly on your PC:
