# Test Case 2

This test case includes the heat diffusing from the LHS of a grain to the RHS of the grain. In this simulation, the materials have been assigned material properties similar to that of the alpha and beta region of Ti64. Due to the differences in thermal expansion, the microstructure will displace. For this reason, a displacement contour map (for the x and y directions) has also been included in this simulation. The folder also includes the original mesh and the mesh after simulation results, which you can see has displaced slightly. The mesh was created using OOF2 (where the mesh file "mesh.txt" can be opened in Abaqus) and the FE simulation was also run on OOF2.

A recommendation for the next test case could be to include multiple grains and grain boundaries and see the impact on the simulation results.
