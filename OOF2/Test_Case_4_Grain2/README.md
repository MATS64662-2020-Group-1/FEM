# Test Case 4

The purpose of this test case is to introduce a stress contour map into the simulation outputs. The image used in this simulation is the grain from the preprocessed images (Ti64_binary_V2.0.png). The material parameters in this test case have been slightly exaggerated to see the impact on results i.e. the thermal expansion and thermal conductivities are slightly unrealistic. You can clearly see a difference in the original mesh and the mesh after the simulation due to the very large difference in thermal expansion. This folder also includes the contour maps for temperature distribution and displacements (x and y) as well as the stress contour plot. The Python log is also included in this folder which can be loaded into the OOF2 environment and the mesh file is also included here (which can be opened in Abaqus)

This is perhaps the last test case as each test case has provided enough results to start to work on the final simulation. The final simulation will include the correct material parameters for Ti64 alpha and beta phases, the temperature distribution will be the same as in the test cases, and the LHS will be fixed (i.e. no displacement). The final simulation will also include a scale bar for reference and a multi-grain microstructure.
