# Test Case 3

This test case uses one of the preprocessed images (Ti64_binary_V5.0.png), which is a binary image and has multiple grains. The purpose of this test case it to simply see the impact of multiple grains on the simulation results. The folder includes the mesh before and after the simulation as a .png file, the temperature and displacement contour plots, the Python log (required to input into the OOF2 environment), a document stating the simulation conditions (e.g. material parameters, boundary conditions etc.) and the mesh file, which can be opened using Abaqus.

A recommendation for a further test case could be to look at stresses present in the microstructure.
