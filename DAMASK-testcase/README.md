## DAMASK Testcase

Presented here is a python code developed to read a .png image into a numpy array, changing pixel values from 0 and 1 to 1 and 2 for use in a DAMASK .geom file.

Due to time constraints, it was not possible to correctly configure the code to transfer the image with no displacement/distortion. The .vtk file shown only displays the .geom file in a visual format, and does *not* represent final simulation visual results.
